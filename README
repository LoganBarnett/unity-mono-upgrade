All I have so far is the Mac version. Feel free to post something for Windows.

1) Copy the .sh file to somewhere on your PATH. ~/bin is on my path, so we'll use that.

cp unity-mono-update.sh ~/bin/unity-mono-update.sh

2) Give it executable permission

chmod +x ~/bin/unity-mono-update.sh

3) Kick it off to upgrade

sudo unity-mono-update.sh

4) ???

5) Profit!

When you upgrade Mono, even for minor versions, just run the script again.
